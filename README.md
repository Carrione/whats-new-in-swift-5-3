# What’s new in Swift 5.3?

This is an Xcode playground that demonstrates the new features introduced in Swift 5.3: 

* Multi-pattern catch clauses
* Multiple trailing closures
* Synthesized Comparable conformance for enums
* `self` is no longer required in many places
* Type-Based Program Entry Points
* `where` clauses on contextually generic declarations
* Enum cases as protocol witnesses
* Refined `didSet` Semantics
* A new `Float16` type
* Swift Package Manager gains binary dependencies, resources, and more
